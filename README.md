# Who are we?

Have you ever wonder what's really in your food? Picture this: you grab a protein bar or snack from your morning swag bag, but do you truly know what's fueling your body? The truth is, that most of us blindly trust food labels without realizing the hidden ingredients and marketing gimmicks lurking within. We've all heard the age-old adage, 'biscuits are better than chips or chocolates,' but did you know that biscuits can pack more sugar than your favorite chocolate bar?
